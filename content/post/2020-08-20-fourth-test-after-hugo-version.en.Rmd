Hello this is Davd again, let's try: 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
rnorm(100)

MA_mean = 2
MA_weight = 0.5
# Generate and plot an MA(1) with parameter .9 
# MA <- arima.sim(model=list(order = c(0,0,1), ma = MA_weight), n = 200, mean = MA_mean,
#                rand.gen = rnorm, sd = 40)
MA <- arima.sim(model=list(order = c(0,0,1), ma = MA_weight), n = 200, mean = MA_mean)
ts.plot(MA)

```
